Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
Description of Experiment and Data

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

Description of variables from tidy data:

The variable "activity.description" is the description of the activity while "activity" is the code for that activity. 

The variable "subject" is the subject test.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The accelerometer and gyroscope measurement variable names have as many as seven components indicating what and how they were measured:

1) "t" or "f" The "t" at the beginning of each acceleration and measurement variable name simply denotes that the measurements are time domain signals. An "f" at the beginning of the variable name indicates that a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to the signal.

2) "Acc" or "Gyro" "Acc" or "Gyro" in the variable names indicates whether the measurement was taken by the accelerometer or the gyroscope.

3) "Body" or "Gravity"
The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity signals using a low pass filter. The "Body" and "Gravity" segments of the variable names indicate which signal measurement the variable contains.

4) "Jerk"
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals-- indicated by "Jerk" in the variable names.

5) "Mag" The magnitude of the three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm, indicated by "Mag" in the variable names.

6) "Mean" or "Std" "mean" and "std" mean that these statistics were estimated for the signal.

7) "X", "Y", or "Z" "X" "Y", or "Z" indicate denote 3-axial signals.

Only those measurements of mean or standard deviations are included in this set.
